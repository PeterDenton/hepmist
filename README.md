## About
This website aims to keep a comprehensive, up-to-date list of anomalies in high energy physics. If you notice some anomalies/proposed solutions/references are missing or any incorrect information, please don't hesitate to create a pull request to propose changes. The step-by-step guide below will show you how to edit the table of anomalies and the pages for proposed explanations. 

## How to edit ?

### The table of anomalies

1. Go to the `/_includes` directory. Download the [`ListofAnomalies.html`](https://github.com/hepcomm/hepmist/blob/main/_includes/ListofAnomalies.html) file.
2. Open the `ListofAnomalies.html` with a word processor (Google Docs is recommended) and make any desired changes.
3. Save the edited document as `ListofAnomalies.html` and upload it to the `/_includes` directory.

### Possible solutions

1. Go to the `/solutions` directory. Edit the [anomaly].md file (e.g. [`muon-g-2.md`](https://github.com/hepcomm/hepmist/blob/main/solutions/muon-g-2.md), [`LFUV-B.md`](https://github.com/hepcomm/hepmist/blob/main/solutions/LFUV-B.md) etc.).
