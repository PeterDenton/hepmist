The theoretical formulation of Standard Model (SM) in particle physics was established in the mid-1970s, and all the elementary particles predicted by the Standard Model have been discovered by 2012. Although SM successfully describes the fundamental interactions among all the known elementary particles accurately to a great extent, there are 5 experimental facts which cannot be explained by SM: gravity, neutrinos masses, matter-antimatter asymmetry, dark matter, and the expansion rate of our universe. Besides these irrefutable experimental evidences, there is also a growing list of experimental results that conflict with SM since Higgs boson's discovery. Some of these interesting anomalies may one day be confirmed and lead to discovering of the new physics beyond the SM. 

This website aims to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date list of anomalies in high energy physics. It was proposed by [Professor Bhupal Dev](https://artsci.wustl.edu/faculty-staff/bhupal-dev) in the [_Unveiling hidden Physics Beyond the Standard Model at the LHC_](https://indico.tlabs.ac.za/event/100/overview) workshop. Community effort is crucial to ensure the information provided on this website is accurate and complete at all times. Thus, this website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/hepcomm/hepmist) and everyone is welcome to contribute.
